            What Is Included and What Is Not

          <p className="text-gray-700 text-[17px] mt-4">
            All <span className="font-black">used engines for sale</span> here
            come with a comprehensive warranty on the long block, or core, of
            the engine. This does not include manifolds, gaskets, seals, hoses,
            and other specific accessories that may include turbos, starters,
            and alternators. Be assured that we do our best to sell
            high-performance running engines, but sometimes small repairs will
            be needed for parts to be replaced, such as water pumps or
            distributor caps; you can nonetheless depend on us for a solid
            foundation.
